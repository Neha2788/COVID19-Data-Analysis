It indicates that either there was a delay in testing for COVID-19 due to which cases could not be controlled or there have been other comorbidities attached with the patients.  Kerala has lower deaths and higher recovery which means it has shown good record in controlling the cases and has provided good medical healthcare support. States with lesser number of both recovery and deaths are having cases only in recent times and evaluation after a few days will be able to clear the air about their condition. </p>

Contrary to other countries, the number of cases below 40 years of are considerbaly higher. Which means that youngsters are equally susceptible to the virus. This can be explained by demography of India which a young nation and most population is below 40 years of age.</p>

However, with the availability of more test kits, more samples are being tested and ICMR has a target to test 1 lakh samples everyday. With lockdown in place, extensive testing will go a long way in controlling the transmission rate of infection. Alongside, more tests will help to mark infected people and quarantine them. It will also help in identifying hotspot areas which are more prone to infection</p> -->
